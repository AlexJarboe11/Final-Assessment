Regression Problem using Linear Regression
============================================

This notebook addresses a healthcare regression problem where the goal is to predict weight based on features such as height, age, and exercise frequency.

Steps:
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: 
  - Synthetic dataset generation simulating a healthcare scenario.
  - Features: height (in cm), age (in years), and exercise frequency (sessions per week).
  - Data is checked for missing values and split into training (80%) and testing sets (20%).

- **Model Training**:
  - A Linear Regression model from scikit-learn is used.

- **Evaluation**:
  - The model is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric.

- **Reflection**:
  - The approach demonstrates a straightforward application of supervised learning in a healthcare context. With more complex data, further feature engineering and model tuning might be necessary.

This serves as an example for solving regression problems in healthcare using machine learning.
